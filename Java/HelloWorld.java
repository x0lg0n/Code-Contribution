/**
 * Hello World Program in Java
 * 
 * This is a simple Java program that demonstrates the basic syntax of Java
 * by printing "Hello World!" to the console. This is traditionally the first
 * program written when learning a new programming language.
 * 
 * <p>The program contains a single class with a main method, which serves
 * as the entry point for Java applications.</p>
 * 
 * <h2>Compilation and Execution:</h2>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * javac HelloWorld.java
 * java HelloWorld
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <h2>Expected Output:</h2>
 * <pre>
 * Hello World!
 * </pre>
