const firstName = "Ashu"; //The firstname and gender of a person is fixed(constant) ie it cannot change so its much better to use the const variable as it then wont allow the variable value to be reassigned.
const gender = "Male";
if (gender == "Male") {
    console.log("Hello, " + firstName);
}
